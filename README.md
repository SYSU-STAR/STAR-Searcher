This repository contains the codebase and associated resources for our [paper]([https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16348]) titled "**Star-Searcher:** An Efficient Aerial **S**ystem for **Tar**get **Search** in Unknown **E**nvi**r**onments ". This work tackles the challenge of autonomous target search using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in complex unknown environments.

The project involves novel algorithms for:

- **Visibility-based viewpoint clustering** , allows the real-time generation of the global path at the level of viewpoint clusters and local path at the level of individual viewpoints with fewer detours.
- **History-aware path planning**, which utilizes historical path information to prevent inconsistency in consecutive planning processes.
- Other useful tools for autonomous search tasks.

## Quick Start

The project has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04(ROS Noetic) and 18.04(ROS Melodic). Take Ubuntu 20.04 as an example, run the following commands to setup:

~~~bash
  sudo apt-get install libnlopt-dev
  cd ${YOUR_WORKSPACE_PATH}/src
  git clone git@github.com:SYSU-STAR/STAR-Searcher.git
  cd ../ 
  catkin_make
~~~

After the compilation you can start the simulation environments by:

~~~bash
source devel/setup.bash && roslaunch exploration_manager env_simulation.launch
~~~

the simulation world filename is also specified in this launch file. After loading the world, run the uav simulation by:

~~~bash
source devel/setup.bash && roslaunch exploration_manager uav_simulation.launch
~~~

Then you can run the simulation and visualization by:

~~~bash
source devel/setup.bash && roslaunch exploration_manager rviz.launch 2> >(grep -v TF_REPEATED_DATA )
source devel/setup.bash && roslaunch exploration_manager search_map1.launch 2> >(grep -v TF_REPEATED_DATA )
~~~

You will find the local map and frontiers in the `rviz` and use the `2D Nav Goal` to send the begin message.

## Known Issues

- If you encounter compilation errors about nlopt, like"No such file nlopt.hpp", please install nlopt manually (refer to this [document](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/NLopt_Installation/)).
